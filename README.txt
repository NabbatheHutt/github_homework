I am a 24 year old resident of New Hampshire.

I am a graduate student in genetics at the University of New Hampshire.

I am working with the USDA to create a phenotyping handbook for Tartary buckwheat.

I am hoping to be able to link variation in the phenotypes across the diversity in Tartary buckwheat to discrete genetic causes in the reference genome.

I have a number of other research interests, and really enjoy coding. I much prefer to work on my computer than to work in the lab. 





This is Chris Gonzalez. I am an expert programmer. (Not really.)

In reality I am a PhD student in MESB MCBS at UNH, and I focus on applying bioinformatic techniques with sequencing data to 
investigate the evolution of large gene families, especially those related to sensory system evolution.

I have long term interests in applying this to the evolution of developmental genes related to morphological adaptation. I also have
a passion for teaching and will probably work at a teaching-focused institution in the future.
